## Classification System Precision

### NAICS/UNSPSC/CPC Intersection Framework
Each level maintains proper classification precision:

**L0**: 2-3 digit NAICS | 2-4 digit UNSPSC | 1-3 char CPC
**L1**: 4 digit NAICS | 4-6 digit UNSPSC | 3-4 char CPC
**L2**: 5 digit NAICS | 6-8 digit UNSPSC | 4-5 char CPC
**L3**: 6 digit NAICS | 8-10 digit UNSPSC | 5-6 char CPC
**L4**: Full classification + specific business/patent focus

### Example Classification Progression
**L1 AI Software**: NAICS 5415 | UNSPSC 4323 | CPC G06N
**L2 AI Design Tools**: NAICS 54151 | UNSPSC 432320 | CPC G06N20
**L3 AI Design Implementation**: NAICS 541511 | UNSPSC 4323200001 | CPC G06N20/00
